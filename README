The frame-accurate seek library extension to ffmpeg requires ffmpeg. 
Getting the most recent version of ffmpeg and building it from source is
recommended:

svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg

The test/example build script requires ffmpeg be checked out (or symlinked)
and built (./configure ; make) from the base directory. 

Features:
1) Simplified interface for video processing 
2) Frame-accurate seeking using a seek-table
3) Online creation of a seek-table through normal decoding
4) Saving and loading of seek-tables.
