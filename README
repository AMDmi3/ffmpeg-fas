This is an extension to the ffmpeg video decoding library meant to support
a variety of extra functionality in support of video processing applications.
The primary additional feature added is the ability to do frame-accurate seeking 
(by frame number). This is accomplished in a codec/format independant manner
using seek tables. 

It has been built and tested under Linux and Windows.

**NOTE [12/09]**: 
This package hasn't been kept fully up-to-date with 
ffmpeg's changing API. Some modification is necessary to remove calls to deprecated 
ffmpeg functionality. Patches welcome. 
*****************

Features:
1) Simplified interface for video processing 
2) Frame-accurate seeking using a seek-table
3) Online creation of a seek-table through normal decoding
4) Saving and loading of seek-tables

Getting up and running:
The frame-accurate seek library extension to ffmpeg requires ffmpeg. 
Getting the most recent version of ffmpeg and building it from source is
recommended:

svn checkout svn://svn.mplayerhq.hu/ffmpeg/trunk ffmpeg

The test/example build script requires ffmpeg be checked out (or symlinked)
and built (./configure ; make) from the base directory.
